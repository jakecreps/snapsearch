# Snapsearch
OSINT tool to check to see if a Snapchat username exists.

Enter a possible Snapchat username and check to see if that Snapchat username exists.

Choose whether you want to check a single username or search in bulk with a csv.

To search in bulk, populate the csv (snapsearch.csv) with all the usernames you want to search.

After a certain number of requests from your IP, Snapcodes stop returning and results show up negative. For me it happened at 232 usernames from csv.
